This VERSION patches cleanly for arm

In this GIT repository, there are several GIT branches named "aufsX.Y".
Here "X.Y" is the version number and it corresponds to the aufs version
(aufs3 and later). Run git-checkout to get the source files of aufs
source files.

For instance, when you are using aufs3.0 (which means your system is
linux-3.0), you should run
	$ git checkout origin/aufs3.0
in this direcotry and you can get the source files for aufs3.0.
To compile and install them, read the README file after "git checkout".

Enjoy!
